# Introduction

[Part 1](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker) demonstrated a development workflow using Docker, docker-compose and Makefiles. This post covers transitioning to Go. Why you might want to, the challenges I faced, and where to begin learning.

We focus on:

- [Why Go?](#why-go)
- [Challenges](#challenges)
- [Training](#training)

# Why Go?

### 1. Many Tools Use Go

While deploying apps into the cloud I realized quite quickly that many of the tools I used were written in Go. Tools including Drone, Portainer, Docker, Kubernetes, and Traefik. I began to wonder what I was missing. What is so special about the langauge?

### 2. Renowned Creators

Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer, are the original creators of the language. All have amazing credentials. They are the same people behind Unix, UTF-8, the B programming language (predecessor to the C programming language) and the Hotspot JVM. Listen to [Creating the Go programming langauge](https://changelog.com/gotime/100) for the full story.

### 3. Simple Concurrency Model

Concurrency is incredibly difficult to get right even when there is language support. Go has [concurrency primatives](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10) called go routines designed to leverage all the cores on your machine. Go is one of the first modern programming languages to do this.

### 4. Fast Compilation

Go has fast compile times because of dependency analysis. In Go unused dependencies are considered a compile-time error not a warning. This guarantees that no extra code will be compiled during builds, minimizing compilation time. Also circular dependencies are not allowed in the language, keeping the dependency tree lean and clean.

### 5. Proper Built-in Tools

The [standard built-in library](https://golang.org/pkg/) is great. The are over 100 packages across 38 categories and each package is well documented.

### 6. 0 Dependency Deployments

Dependencies are not required because everything is compiled into a static binary. Static binaries tend to be small in size. In combination with Docker you can acheive super light weight images. Making go appilcations great for container deployments.

### 8. Tooling and UX

Go tooling provides many commands for many development concerns. To name a few, there's `go test` for testing, `go mod` for module support and `go tool pprof` for code profiler).

Even the creator of Node, who abandoned Node used Go. Ryan Dahl later developed [Deno](https://deno.land/manual). Deno was originally written in Go before being [replaced with Rust](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/205). After the transition the Go UX remained. For example `deno fmt` comes from the `go fmt` which is a configure-less code formatter.

# Challenges

Migrating from Node to Go is not without its challenges. I am still making the transition myself. Beyond language syntax and mechanics, I faced 3 challenges building production ready services.

### 1. Rethinking The Way An App Is Structured

In Go, you need develop your own set of rules about where packages belong and stick to them. I learned that your application won't compile if you have circular dependencies. In other words, two packages can't cross import one another. This keeps dependency chains clear as well as your mental model of the codebase. It forces you to consider where initialization occurs in your app. Folders also have a special purpose in Go. Folders are modules, components, or features with distinct APIs. Not a means to organize code arbitrarily. Folders represent unique and purposeful packages containing exported and unexported identifiers.

### 2. Choosing Between Built-in Libraries Or 3rd-party Packages

Rolling your own solutions with standard Go libraries takes time but how it works is transparent because you built it. Using a framework takes arguably less time and comes with a rich feature set, but it's not so clear what happens under the hood. With a full-featured library you might only use a fraction of the available features.

### 3. Choosing Between An ORM Or Going Bare Metal With SQL

An ORM like [GORM](https://gorm.io/) can get you to your destination faster but it comes with a cost. GORM can make more queries than otherwise needed under the hood. Going ORM-less already sets you up for taking advantage of the full power of postgres with raw SQL queries. Plus, ORMs can't possibly cover every use case and you may end up locked in and with out some functionality in complex scenarios. ORMs must be learned and you can't carry that knowledge to other projects if you're not using the same tool. SQL knowledge is always relevant between relational databases. SQL is transparent since you always know the cost of a your queries.

# Training

Every new go developer should read [Effective Go](). It summarizes _idiomatic_ Go development, in other words, _the Go way_ to do things. Todd McLeod's Udemy course [Web Development w/ Googleâ€™s Go (golang) Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language) is a comprehensive guide to the language fundamentals. For a more project based book tutorial try [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards. Another classic book is [The Go Programming Langauge](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B0184N7WWS/) by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.

Even with these sources, I was still eager to find production ready service examples. Not a web app and nothing basic. I wanted a complete guide I could tinker with. Ardan Labs scratched my itch. Thankfully, I heard about them last year and attended a workshop in Berlin. It placed me on the right track. I highly recommend their [workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/ardan-labs-7092394651?utm_source=ardan_website&utm_medium=scrolling_banner&utm_campaign=website_livestream_promo) and [courses](https://education.ardanlabs.com/).

The [next post](ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker-part3) in the series is about building a production ready service.
