## Intro

Lately, I've been interested in migrating APIs from Node to Go. With Node, I had the ultimate workflow, but I had a problem achieving a similar one with Go. This post illustrates the use of docker compose to automate live reloading a Go API on code changes, debugging it with breakpoints and running tests.

Warning: For the most part this tutorial is IDE agnostic except for the last section on debugging with VSCode.

### Docker

### Project starter

### Multi-stage Builds 

### Docker Compose

### Live Reload

### Traefik

### Setting up Postgres

### Running Tests

### Debugging with VSCode

** If you're planning on using VSCode, I recommended installing [Hadolint's VSCode intergation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=exiasr.hadolint), it will keep you from adopting bad practices in your Dockerfiles. There's also [integrations for Vim](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/blob/master/docs/INTEGRATION.md#vim-and-neovim).

### Conclusion
