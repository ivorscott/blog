  Lately, I've been interested in migrating APIs from Node to Go. With Node, I
  had the ultimate workflow, but I had a problem achieving a similar one with
  Go. This post illustrates the use of docker compose to automate live reloading
  a Go API on code changes, debugging it with breakpoints and running tests.

## Why I'm writing this

Since I started deploying apps to the cloud and leveraging multiple tools like Docker, Portainer, Traefik and Drone, I have been forced to recognize that many of my beloved infrastructure tools use Go. It seemed as if every where I turned I was using some open source go library in my day to day deployment workflow.

Coming from NodeJS, I first struggled to achieve my old workflow in Go, which mostly consisted of live reloading and debugging an api in VSCode.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a way to live reload a go api and debug it at the same time, in the same container. So if you are reading this and have any insights on this I would love to hear from you.

I ended up settling with live reloading an api in one container and then on the fly, or when I needed to, launching a debuggable api in a separate container without live reload. This seemed to be a good compromise because I'm usually only debugging when I know I have a problem. At that point, I can simply launch another container to investigate.

## The Goal

We will start with a completed sample api to focus our attention on building tooling around it to support Docker, docker-compose, multi-stage builds, live reloading, Traefik, Postgres, testing and debugging.
