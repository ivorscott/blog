# Introduction

[Part 6](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker-part6) shared a CICD approach with Drone and Portainer.

We focus on:

- [OAuth](#oauth)
- [Auth0](#auth0)

## Requirements

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com/)

## Getting Started

Clone the project repo and checkout `part5`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivorscott/go-delve-reload
cd go-delve-reload
git checkout part5
```

Please review [Setting Up VSCode](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker#setting-up-vscode) to avoid intellisense errors in VSCode. This occurs because the Go module directory is not the project root.

# OAuth

# Auth0

# Conclusion

In the [next post](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker-part6) I discuss Observability Metrics in Go.
