# Introduction

[Part 7](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker-part7) was about adding authentication and authorization to the Go API using Auth0. This post covers "Observability Metrics".

We focus on:

- [Open Telemetry](#open-telemetry)
- [Prometheus](#prometheus)
- [Grafana](#grafana)

## Requirements

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com/)

# Demo

## Getting Started

Clone the project repo and checkout `part2`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivorscott/go-delve-reload
cd go-delve-reload
git checkout part6
```

Please review [Setting Up VSCode](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker#setting-up-vscode) to avoid intellisense errors in VSCode. This occurs because the Go module directory is not the project root.

# Open Telemetry

# Prometheus

# Grafana

# Conclusion

In the [next post](/ultimate-go-react-development-setup-with-docker-part7) I discuss Deploying with Docker Swarm and Traefik.
