My name is Ivor (pronounced ee-vor or ey-vor). My friends call me Scott. I'm a freelance Software Engineer with a Masters in Fine Arts. I'm also the Teaching Assistant for the Docker and Kubernetes Mastery courses on Udemy taught by Docker Captain Bret Fisher.

I've been living in Berlin since 2017, trying to find a balance between two careers: in art and technology. I enjoy teaching, painting, reading and traveling. I hope to share some stuff I know through this technology blog.
